Liza: Arnold got home after a long day of work and was so excited to eat his sandwich from Jimmy Johns. The day before, he had gone out to eat with friends and had extras of his sandwich ready to eat that he was so excited to eat today. But when he got home, he came to a shocking realization: the sandwich was gone!

Rowan: Where could it have gone? Arnold was very perplexed. He had no pets, and his neighbors couldn't of gotten into his house! Then, Arnold had a stroke of luck, and saw some lettuce on the floor, followed by a bit of tomato, creating a path that lead out his backdoor.

David: Arnold's back door was still locked, with the door chain still in place.
Nobody could have gone out this way, yet the sandwich trail leads there.
Looking again, he noticed a pile of crumbs and some smears of mayo going under the door.
Unlocking his door and following the trail outside, he ended up finding the culprits.
Hundreds of ants were swarming around his sandwich, trying to fit the whole thing into an anthill.
Having lost his appetite, but getting in a good laugh, Arnold went back inside to find a way to keep the ants out.
